# *To the reader*

Welcome to the R package building helper *readme2pkg.template*\!

Below, is a readme that provides steps for building a package. This
readme acts as a worksheet, checklist, and control document as functions
used in package building are included within.

We’ll use the `{readme2pkg}` helper package to send code chunks to
different directories in the package.

To install `{readme2pkg}`:

``` 

remotes::install.github("EvaMaeRey/readme2pkg")
```

# Part 0. Proposal

Proposing the {xxxx} package\! 🦄
<!-- (typical package introduction write up; but actually aspirational) -->

The goal of {xxxx} is to make … easier.

Without the package, we live in the effort-ful world that follows 🏋:

``` r
x <- 4

2*x
#> [1] 8
```

With the {xxxx} package, we’ll live in a different world (🦄 🦄 🦄) where
the task is a snap 🫰:

Proposed API:

``` 

library(xxxxx)

xxxxx::times_two(x = 4)
```

# Part I. Work out functionality ✅

Here is a function that will do some work…

``` r
times_two <- function(x){
  
  x*2
  
}
```

## Try it out

``` r
times_two(4)
#> [1] 8
```

# Part II. Packaging and documentation 🚧 ✅

## Phase 1. Minimal working package

### Bit A. Created package archetecture, running `devtools::create(".")` in interactive session. 🚧 ✅

``` r
devtools::create(".")
```

### Bit B. Added roxygen skeleton? 🚧 ✅

Use a roxygen skeleton for auto documentation and making sure proposed
functions are *exported*. Generally, early on, I don’t do much
(anything) in terms of filling in the skeleton for documentation,
because things may change.

### Bit C. Managed dependencies ? 🚧 ✅

Package dependencies managed, i.e. `depend::function()` in proposed
functions and declared in the DESCRIPTION

``` r
usethis::use_package("ggplot2")
```

### Bit D. Moved functions R folder? 🚧 ✅

Use new {readme2pkg} function to do this from readme…

``` r
readme2pkg::chunk_to_r("times_two")
```

### Bit E. Run `devtools::check()` and addressed errors. 🚧 ✅

``` r
devtools::check(pkg = ".")
```

### Bit F. Build package 🚧 ✅

``` r
devtools::build()
```

### Bit G. Write traditional README that uses built package (also serves as a test of build. 🚧 ✅

The goal of the {xxxx} package is to …

Install package with:

    remotes::installgithub("EvaMaeRey/readme2pkg.template")

Once functions are exported you can remove go to two colons, and when
things are are really finalized, then go without colons (and rearrange
your readme…)

``` r
library(mypacakge)  ##<< change to your package name here
mypacakge:::times_two(10)
```

### Bit H. Chosen a license? 🚧 ✅

``` r
usethis::use_mit_license()
```

### Bit I. Add lifecycle badge (experimental)

``` r
usethis::use_lifecycle_badge("experimental")
```

## Phase 2: Listen & iterate 🚧 ✅

Try to get feedback from experts on API, implementation, default
decisions. Is there already work that solves this problem?

## Phase 3: Let things settle

### Bit A. Settle on examples. Put them in the roxygen skeleton and readme. 🚧 ✅

### Bit B. Written formal tests of functions and save to test that folders 🚧 ✅

That would look like this…

``` r
library(testthat)

test_that("calc times 2 works", {
  expect_equal(times_two(4), 8)
  expect_equal(times_two(5), 10)
  
})
```

``` r
readme2pkg::chunk_to_tests_testthat("test_calc_times_two_works")
```

### Bit C. Added a description and author information in the DESCRIPTION file 🚧 ✅

### Bit D. Addressed *all* notes, warnings and errors. 🚧 ✅

## Phase 4. Promote to wider audience…

### Bit A. Package website built? 🚧 ✅

### Bit B. Package website deployed? 🚧 ✅

## Phase 5: Harden/commit

### Submit to CRAN/RUniverse? 🚧 ✅

# Appendix: Reports, Environment

## Edit Description file

``` r
readLines("DESCRIPTION")
```

## Environment

Here I just want to print the packages and the versions

``` r
all <- sessionInfo() |> print() |> capture.output()
all[11:17]
#> [1] ""                                                                         
#> [2] "attached base packages:"                                                  
#> [3] "[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     "
#> [4] ""                                                                         
#> [5] "loaded via a namespace (and not attached):"                               
#> [6] " [1] compiler_4.2.2  fastmap_1.1.1   cli_3.6.1       tools_4.2.2    "     
#> [7] " [5] htmltools_0.5.4 rstudioapi_0.14 yaml_2.3.7      rmarkdown_2.20 "
```

## `devtools::check()` report

``` r
devtools::check(pkg = ".")
#> Error in `package_file()`:
#> ! Could not find package root.
#> ℹ Is '.' inside a package?
```
