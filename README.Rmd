# *To the reader* 

Welcome to the R package building helper *readme2pkg.template*!

Below, is a readme that provides steps for building a package.  This readme acts as a worksheet, checklist, and control document as functions used in package building are included within.  

We'll use the `{readme2pkg}` helper package to send code chunks to different directories in the package.  

To install `{readme2pkg}`:

```

remotes::install.github("EvaMaeRey/readme2pkg")

```

# Part 0. Proposal

Proposing the {xxxx} package! 🦄 
<!-- (typical package introduction write up; but actually aspirational) -->

The goal of {xxxx} is to make ... easier.


Without the package, we live in the effort-ful world that follows 🏋:

```{r}
x <- 4

2*x

```

  
With the {xxxx} package, we'll live in a different world (🦄 🦄 🦄) where the task is a snap 🫰: 

Proposed API:

```

library(xxxxx)

xxxxx::times_two(x = 4)

```



# Part I. Work out functionality  ✅ 

Here is a function that will do some work...


```{r times_two}
times_two <- function(x){
  
  x*2
  
}
```


## Try it out

```{r}
times_two(4)
```


# Part II. Packaging and documentation  🚧 ✅ 

## Phase 1. Minimal working package

### Bit A. Created package archetecture, running `devtools::create(".")` in interactive session. 🚧 ✅


```{r, eval = F}
devtools::create(".")
```

### Bit B. Added roxygen skeleton? 🚧 ✅

Use a roxygen skeleton for auto documentation and making sure proposed functions are *exported*.  Generally, early on, I don't do much (anything) in terms of filling in the skeleton for documentation, because things may change.

### Bit C. Managed dependencies ? 🚧 ✅

Package dependencies managed, i.e. `depend::function()` in proposed functions and declared in the DESCRIPTION

```{r, eval = F}
usethis::use_package("ggplot2")
```


### Bit D. Moved functions R folder? 🚧 ✅

Use new {readme2pkg} function to do this from readme...

```{r, eval = F}
readme2pkg::chunk_to_r("times_two")
```



### Bit E. Run `devtools::check()` and addressed errors. 🚧 ✅

```{r, eval = F}
devtools::check(pkg = ".")
```

### Bit F. Build package 🚧 ✅

```{r, eval = F}
devtools::build()
```


### Bit G. Write traditional README that uses built package (also serves as a test of build. 🚧 ✅ 

The goal of the {xxxx} package is to ...

Install package with:

```
remotes::installgithub("EvaMaeRey/readme2pkg.template")
```

Once functions are exported you can remove go to two colons, and when things are are really finalized, then go without colons (and rearrange your readme...)

```{r, eval = F}
library(mypacakge)  ##<< change to your package name here
mypacakge:::times_two(10)
```




### Bit H. Chosen a license? 🚧 ✅


```{r, eval = F}
usethis::use_mit_license()
```

### Bit I. Add lifecycle badge (experimental)

```{r, eval = F}
usethis::use_lifecycle_badge("experimental")
```


## Phase 2: Listen & iterate 🚧 ✅

Try to get feedback from experts on API, implementation, default decisions.  Is there already work that solves this problem? 


## Phase 3: Let things settle

### Bit A. Settle on examples.  Put them in the roxygen skeleton and readme. 🚧 ✅

### Bit B. Written formal tests of functions and save to test that folders 🚧 ✅


That would look like this...

```{r test_calc_times_two_works, eval = F}
library(testthat)

test_that("calc times 2 works", {
  expect_equal(times_two(4), 8)
  expect_equal(times_two(5), 10)
  
})
```


```{r, eval = F}
readme2pkg::chunk_to_tests_testthat("test_calc_times_two_works")
```


### Bit C. Added a description and author information in the DESCRIPTION file 🚧 ✅

### Bit D. Addressed *all* notes, warnings and errors. 🚧 ✅

## Phase 4. Promote to wider audience...

### Bit A. Package website built? 🚧 ✅

### Bit B. Package website deployed? 🚧 ✅

## Phase 5: Harden/commit

### Submit to CRAN/RUniverse? 🚧 ✅

# Appendix: Reports, Environment

## Edit Description file

```{r, eval = F}
readLines("DESCRIPTION")
```

## Environment

Here I just want to print the packages and the versions

```{r}
all <- sessionInfo() |> print() |> capture.output()
all[11:17]
```

## `devtools::check()` report

```{r, error = T, results="hide", warning=F}
devtools::check(pkg = ".")
```
